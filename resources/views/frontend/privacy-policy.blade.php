                        protected both online and offline.

                        transmitted to us in a secure way. You can verify this by looking for a lock icon 
                        in the address bar and looking for "https" at the beginning of the address of the Web page.
                        While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also protect
                        your information offline. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific 
                        job (for example, billing or customer service) are granted access to personally identifiable
